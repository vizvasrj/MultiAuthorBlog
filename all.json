gravity as an \"emergent\" force not fundamental.\r\n    The scientist thinks his ideas describe the universe better than existing models, without resorting to \"dark matter\".\r\n    While some question his previous papers, Verlinde is reworking his ideas as a full-fledged theory.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Dutch theoretical physicist Erik Verlinde is no stranger to big ideas. His 2009 hypothesis about gravity earned him comparisons to Einstein for its complete rethinking of what gravity could be. Verlinde proposed that gravity was not a fundamental force of nature but rather emerged out of the interactions of information that fills the universe. He also didn't think there was such a thing as \"dark matter\" – a useful construct which is supposedly taking up 27% of the known universe (but is yet to be observed). Now, in a new interview, Verlinde reveals he is taking steps towards conceptualizing his groundbreaking ideas in a full-fledged theory.\r\n\r\nAs reported by the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO), Verlinde understands why many had trouble accepting his original proposal. After all, the previous leading explanations of gravity have been by Newton, who saw it as an invisible pulling force, and Einstein, who conceived of it as a curvature of space-time by mass and energy.\r\n\r\nIn Verlinde's view, based on string theory, quantum information theory and the physics of black holes, gravity is an \"entropic\" force that comes into existence as a result of \"information associated with the positions of material bodies,\" as he wrote in his 2011 paper. What drives gravity is the quantum entanglement of tiny bits of spacetime information.\r\n\r\nTen years after publishing his ideas in a paper that caused much discussion, both from admirers and critics, Verlinde shares that he is still fleshing them out, based on the research and advancements that have taken place since then.\r\n\r\n\"Over the past ten years, we have gradually learned a lot more about how you should talk about space and time information,\" said Verlinde to NWO. \"I am seriously considering rewriting my story from 2009, but now formulated much more precisely. I think that could remove some of the scepticism that still exists.'­­\r\nVerlinde: Gravity Doesn't Exist\r\n\r\nIn 2016, Verlinde's ideas were tested by a team from Leiden Observatory, which found that a key prediction of the physicist held up. They studied the lensing effect of gravitational fields that are far away from the centers of more than 33,000 galaxies and found the numbers to be consistent with what the Dutch scientist's theory showed. The only way to get these calculations to match under the prevalent gravitational theory would have been to invoke dark matter – a potential fudge factor more than fact at this point.\r\n\r\nA 2017 study from Princeton University found against Verlinde's ideas, however, showing that they are not consistent with the observed data on the rotation velocities of dwarf galaxies.\r\n\r\nWhile some have accused of Verlinde of publishing his thoughts too early, before they are packaged in a theory that explains all of the implications, the scientist thinks such naysayers don't really understand the way theoretical physics works. \"You need to elaborate and test a new idea step-by-step,\" he explains, adding \"We must find the correct formulations and techniques.'\r\n\r\nScientists like the theoretician Koenraad Schalm from Leiden University defend Verlinde, saying that \"Contrary to the sceptics' opinions, Verlinde's work is definitely taken seriously\". In fact, Verlinde, who is the winner of the Spinoza Prize, has been cited over 700 times by other scientists.\r\n\r\nThe physicist himself feels his overall thesis that information is the fundamental building mechanism of the universe is becoming more accepted. Perhaps his long-awaited new paper on the subject can bring it to an even stronger position amidst the main physics ideas of our time.\r\nDark matter and dark energy explained | Erik Verlinde", "created": "2021-08-25T15:32:34.313Z", "updated": "2021-08-25T15:32:56.792Z", "publish": "2021-08-25T15:31:17Z", "status": "published", "total_likes": 0, "users_like": [], "bookmark_list": []}}, {"model": "blog.post", "pk": 2, "fields": {"title": "Scientists discover why fish evolved limbs and left water", "category": null, "cover": "cover/2021/08/25/deviantart_881329963_Skull_Island_-_Photoshop_Art.jpg", "slug": "scientists-discover-why-fish-evolved-limbs-and-lef", "author": 1, "body": "<ul><li>A new study says solar and lunar tide impacts led to the evolution of bony fish and tetrapods.</li><li>The scientists show that tides created tidal pools, stranding fish and forcing them to get out of the water.</li><li>The researchers ran computer simulations to get their results.</li></ul><p>Tides influenced by the sun and the moon were likely the reason why fish developed limbs and early tetrapods evolved, found new research.</p><p>The groundbreaking study took a look at tides during the Late Silurian—Devonian periods, which happened between 420 million years ago and 380 million years ago.</p><p>The scientists built their work on the theory that the Moon's mass and specific location along its orbit can greatly affect vast tidal ranges across Earth and can create tidal pools.

They spotted a collision where one black hole was almost four times larger than another, expanding our understanding of such space cataclysms with help from Einstein (and even Elvis).</p><p>All mergers detected previously involved partners of comparable sizes. The event detected on April 12th, 2019 was called \"exceptional\" by <strong>Maya Fishbach</strong>, an astrophysicist at the University of Chicago in Illinois. What she and her colleagues found proves that very unevenly matched black hole pairs exist. \"This is the first event in which we can confidently say the mass-ratio is not one,\" she stated during an <a href=\"https://aps-april.onlineeventpro.freeman.com/\">online meeting</a> of the American Physical Society.</p><p>The research was carried out in collaboration between the <a href=\"https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/\">Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) </a>— twin detectors in Washington and Louisiana — as well as the <a href=\"http://www.virgo-gw.eu/\">Virgo observatory</a> near Pisa, Italy. They both detected the merger. One of the black holes observed was <strong>30 times</strong> more massive than the sun and was spinning, said the scientists, while the other had a mass about <strong>eight times</strong> that of the sun.</p><p>In an amusing note, the scientists say that the very different masses created gravitational waves at multiple frequencies, which were actually in harmony with an Elvis Presley song. This cosmic music also confirms yet again Einstein's theory of general relativity.</p><p>Normally, two spiraling black holes of the same size would emit a single frequency, which would be double the rate at which they are orbiting one another, <a href=\"https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/04/gravitational-waves-reveal-unprecedented-collision-heavy-and-light-black-holes\">explains</a> Science Magazine. In this case, as predicted by Einstein, the very different masses, also produce <i>overtones</i> - weaker waves at higher frequencies.

Long term stays are even more recent. The difficulties these stays can cause, such as reduced bone mass and vision problems, are increasingly well known. However, new issues are still being discovered. Just last week, a new <a href=\"https://pubs.rsna.org/doi/full/10.1148/radiol.2020191413\">study</a> suggested that long term spaceflight has yet another side effect, structural changes to the brain itself.</p><h3>I think my desire to go to space just declined a bit.</h3><p>Eleven astronauts, ten men and one woman, were given MRI tests before they went for extended stays on the International Space Station. They were then given follow up scans the day after their return and at several points during the year <a href=\"https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2020-04/rson-lsa040720.php\">after</a>.</p><p>Not only did the researchers find that long-term exposure to zero-gravity increased the amount of cerebrospinal fluid in the brain, but that the amount of white matter in the brain increased as well. Several of the astronauts also had deformed pituitary glands, the gland that tells all the others what to do, as a result of the increased pressure on it.&nbsp;<br><br>These changes lasted for some time, just as other astronauts' vision problems have continued for years after returning to Earth. This suggests that some of the effects, particularly the increased amount of fluid, might be permanent. The higher amount of fluid also flowed through the cerebral aqueduct at an increased velocity.</p><p>The researchers hypothesized that these changes, like the previously mentioned vision problems, were caused by increased pressure in the head itself caused by an increased amount of fluid present, including blood. While Earth's gravity causes fluid to flow out of the head and pool towards the lower part of the body, weightlessness removes this tendency, and fluids begin to shift their locations. This effect <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/sn/tvradio/programmes/spaceodyssey/healtheffects.shtml\">has been known</a> for a while and is also why many astronauts look like they skipped leg day or have puffy faces when they take pictures in space.</p><h3>What does this mean? Are astronauts in danger?</h3><p>It is too early to say what these changes to the brain mean. While some of the changes are associated with other symptoms, none of those have been seen in any of the astronauts yet.</p><p>However, ideas for how to reduce the build-up of fluids in the head are already being put forward. One suggestion is to create artificial gravity through the rotation of a centrifuge, like <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2013/06/artificial-gravity-in-the-spinning-discovery-one/\">the spaceship in \"2001: A Space Odyssey\"</a> has, or to create negative pressure around the lower parts of the body to draw fluid to them. Either of these mechanisms would cause less fluid to remain in the head.</p><p>The human body evolved to function decently in an environment where gravity is always a factor. As humanity ventures out towards the stars, the problem of how to keep that body working in such an alien environment will be a substantial obstacle. However, if we can solve the problem of getting into space in the first place, the issue of keeping fluid out of our heads seems comparatively simple.</p>", "created": "2021-08-25T15:57:22.411Z", "updated": "2021-08-25T15:57:22.411Z", "publish": "2021-08-25T15:57:22.408Z", "status": "published", "total_likes": 0, "users_like": [], "bookmark_list": []}}, {"model": "blog.post", "pk": 5, "fields": {"title": "Famous map of a woman’s heart tells only half the story", "category": null, "cover": "cover/2021/08/25/deviantart_880722913_Light_Balloon_-__Photoshop_Art.jpg", "slug": "famous-map-of-a-womans-heart-tells-only-half-the-s", "author": 1, "body": "<ul><li>Early 19th century heart-shaped map remains a popular allegory of love.</li><li>Looking beyond its shape, the map shows the social restrictions of its time.</li><li>Its lesser known male twin reveals an even more pessimistic take on love.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNzI4MDAzNC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY3NDY5Mjg1OH0.ASAGg-R-a5FXFtnw7Y85NQ5W2KJQspvgEvCVAFtVNMo/img.jpg?quality=80&amp;width=599\"></p><ul><li>&nbsp;<ul><li>&nbsp;</li><li>&nbsp;</li><li>&nbsp;</li><li>&nbsp;</li><li>&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li>&nbsp;</li><li>&nbsp;</li></ul><p>\"Kiss me quick\": a humorous take on the social minefield that had to be navigated in early 19th century courtships.

We recognize its joys and perils even as it manifests itself in other ages and under different constraints. That may explain the enduring popularity of this decidedly antique allegory of love. It is entitled <i>A Map of the Open Country of Woman's Heart</i>.</p><p>The map continues the centuries-old conceit that the various aspects of love (and marriage) can be represented as an actual landscape and that a map can serve as a guide into their interrelatedness — a road map of love, so to speak. The map's title indeed goes on to specify that it \"exhibit[s the heart's] internal communications and the facilities and dangers to Travellers therein.\"</p><p>Other famous amorous topographies include George Skaife Beeching's <i>Map of Matrimony</i> (ca. 1880) and the <i>Carte de Tendre</i> (1654), a double-entendre invented for Madame de Scudéry's historical novel <i>Clélie</i> (see <a href=\"https://bigthink.com/strange-maps/245-loves-topography-la-carte-de-tendre\">Strange Maps #245</a>). But what sets this map apart, and what may explain its continuing appeal, is that it presents the landscape of love not as random continents but in the very shape of a heart — not the actual organ but the stylized one we still associate with tender feelings (and playing cards).<br>&nbsp;</p><p>By its recognizable form, sentimental topic, and visible antiquity, <i>Woman's Heart</i> has become a staple of graphic design to this day.

Kellogg &amp; Co. in Hartford, Connecticut), it can reliably be dated to 1833-1842. In other words, the map shows how women were supposed to feel about relationships, love, and marriage in mid-19th century New England. In short, love is an \"open country\" with many choices — all bad, dangerous, and detrimental except for one. Starting from top right:</p><ul><li>The Land of <strong>Love of Display </strong>is washed by the Sea of Wealth and contains the towns of <i>Belles-maisons</i> and <i>Mavoiture</i> (fancy houses and carriages?), a Bay of Establishment, a Jewelry Inlet, an Opal Isle, and a Promontory of Golden Fetters. We did not fail to notice Old Man's Darling Bay (sugardaddyism has some pedigree).</li><li>The Pyramids of Fashion dominate the Land of <strong>Love of Dress</strong>, home to the towns of <i>Cashmere</i> and <i>Tambourton</i> (?) and such natural features as the Satin Plains, Bonnet Ridge, Feather Hill, and the rivers Drain the Purse and Wilful Waste.</li><li>The region of <strong>Sentimentality</strong> is a particularly dangerous one with its Ego Mountains, the Plain of Susceptibility, its rivers of Novel Reading (<i>vade retro</i>, Jane Austen!), Pensive Musings, and the town of <i>Dandy's Rest</i>.</li><li>How much safer is the region of <strong>Sentiment</strong>, dominated by Platonic Affection, Friendship, Hope, Enthusiasm, Good Sense, Discrimination (not that kind), and Prudence. This area is crisscrossed by the Patience Canal and the River of Consciousness. Did it really need to be underlined that these lead straight to the Country of <strong>Solid Worth</strong>?</li><li>Oh, but so narrow is the part of righteous love. Right next door is the Land of <strong>Selfishness</strong>, home to the City of <i>Moi-Même</i>, District No. 1, and the Indulgence River. In the region of Fickleness, you can visit <i>Caprice</i>, the Town of <i>Lady's Privilege</i>, and the road of False Hopes. Obviously, the next stop is the Land of <strong>Oblivion</strong>.</li><li>North of there, we find the Land of <strong>Love of Admiration</strong>, with its districts of Vanity and Affectation, its Lake of Self Conceit, and the Flattery River; and the Land of Coquetry, almost bare except for the Tenting Ground of Uncertainty.</li><li>The northern borders of Coquetry and Love of Fashion are the High Grounds of Matrimonial Speculations with the Country of <strong>Eligibleness</strong> just beyond. But look out for the Valley of Mothers' Artifice and the Province of Deception.</li></ul><p>Dear heavens, there are so many ways the voyage out of the <strong>City and District of Love</strong>, at the center of the heart, can go wrong. Love's saving grace is that it naturally borders and easily connects to Sentiment, the one and only pathway toward Esteem.</p><p>Clearly, love in 1830s Connecticut had to fit into a strict corset of social mores, ultimately dictated by religious piety. While this map showed that the true course was clear, it also demonstrated that the potential pitfalls were several — but many are no longer recognized as such in today's consumerist society. (Few people still seem to worry about the corrupting nature of satin.)</p><p>So, <i>Woman's Heart</i> is more out of step with today's relationship goals than a superficial glance suggests. But there is more. The map is only one half of a long-forgotten pair, which together paint a decidedly pessimistic picture of love.</p><h2>A map for the lesser half</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNzI4MDA3NC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY5MDMxNTM3Mn0.XOpVENJ-Sw0Z_w4wV9O_r5t8zhyXb9L3cG6WdqXxjDA/img.jpg?quality=80&amp;width=599\"></p><ul><li>&nbsp;<ul><li>&nbsp;</li><li>&nbsp;</li><li>&nbsp;</li><li>&nbsp;</li><li>&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li>&nbsp;</li><li>&nbsp;</li></ul><p>A man's heart is his fortress.

The other map shows the Fortified Country of Man's Heart. This is a decidedly less \"open\" place than Woman's Heart: the map shows its defences, and modes of exposure to attack.</p><p>Again, various regions are presented, only one of which leads to matrimonial bliss. Starting from top right:</p><ul><li>The Lands of <strong>Better Judgment</strong> and <strong>Love of Ease</strong> both border a region where Irresolution reigns, feeding the Frozen Lakes of Indifference via the Trop de Trouble river. In the south, a Cigar Grove leads to a Morass of Indolence. Silence and Reflection are walled off from the outside world by a<i> Wall of dread of a woman's tongue.</i></li><li>Is all well in the land of <strong>Romance</strong>? It's unclear: there is a river of Day Dreams (surely not a good thing) and one of Novel Reading (judged too Sentimental for women) and a Forest of Fancy. Nevertheless, this is the only part of Man's Heart that is not walled off. An Angel Gate corresponds with an Avenue of Beauty.</li><li>To the west is the significantly larger Land of <strong>Love of Money</strong>, where we find Lakes Pocket Book and Bank Stock, a Sell Soul Market, Whisker Prairie, and the Corner Towers of Suspicion.</li><li>Northward, we enter the lands of <strong>Love of Eating</strong> (featuring Gingerbread Palace), <strong>Economy</strong> (with the River of Hard Earnings), and <strong>Love of Power</strong> (dominated in the south by the Mountains of Pride and in the north by the Inner Breast-work of Fears of Petticoat Government).</li></ul><p>At the center of it all is the virtually impenetrable <strong>Citadel of Selflove</strong>. But for the breach along the Land of Romance, Man's Heart is entirely surrounded by fortifications with only a handful of avenues communicating with a woman's Good Sense, Housewifery, Fortune, and Good Temper.</p><p>Faced first with the difficulty of mastering her own heart, the eligible young woman of mid-19th century New England was then tasked with conquering that of an eligible young man. As this map shows, that heart was a citadel, designed to deflect virtually all amorous intentions. And no matter how well she prepared, the only surefire avenue into the undefended portion of his heart was one beyond anyone's control: beauty.</p><p>How disheartening (no pun intended).

Every known material creates it, and it is often disproportionately powerful compared to the amount of energy it takes to create. Yet, amazingly, this everyday electrical phenomenon had no widely accepted scientific explanation — perhaps, until now.</p><p>The solution, hidden in a dense thicket of math, was created by Alex Lin and Christopher Mizzi, two Northwestern doctoral students working in the lab of Professor Laurence Marks. Their answer lies in microscopic protrusions on a material's surface, and in two old physics concepts that had been overlooked for decades.</p><p>If the model holds up, it may have broad practical applications, helping scientists suppress static sparks where they can be dangerous — and perhaps even harnessing static electricity to power medical devices or to boost wind generators.</p><h2>What causes static electricity?</h2><p>\"Everybody has seen triboelectricity,\" says Marks, in his low, laconic English accent, using the scientific term for static electricity. \"But when you start asking 'well, why does it occur?' nobody really knows. Or at least nobody knew, at least as far as I'm concerned.\"</p><p>The first record of the phenomena in the Western world was in 600 BC. Thales of Miletus, the father of Greek philosophy, rubbed a piece of amber against fur. His newly charged pelt began attracting dust like a copy of Infinite Jest. Since then, many theories for what causes static electricity followed; none have been accepted by everyone.</p><p>Marks thought the answer might lie in two phenomena we already understand: friction and flexoelectricity. Friction is well understood and clearly crucial to static electricity, somehow, as anyone who has rubbed their socks on carpet can attest.</p><p>The other component (flexoelectricity) is a bit more exotic. All materials have a molecular structure, and when that structure is bent in irregular ways, that shifting can create an electric charge. Marks thought that combining these two concepts might create a useful model for triboelectricity.</p><p>\"I eventually persuaded Alex (Lin) and Chris (Mizzi) — with a little encouragement — and they did most of the work,\" Marks laughs. Lin and Mizzi, bouncing ideas off Marks, pushed forward for half a year before arriving at their model.</p><p>Even surfaces that look completely flat are covered with small protrusions at the nanoscale. When these tiny protrusions rub against each other, thanks to friction, they create flexoelectricity; the charge created by this effect causes what we call static electricity. It's a beautifully simple model, made from well-worn parts, even as the processes it explains are complex.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNzIyNjQ3MS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY4OTQ4MTY1N30.UyxLllMWrXAclln6dlz6bnBf5KCY9tQU03QHo0S3FYE/img.jpg?quality=80&amp;width=639\"></p><ul><li>&nbsp;<ul><li>&nbsp;</li><li>&nbsp;</li><li>&nbsp;</li><li>&nbsp;</li><li>&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li>&nbsp;</li><li>&nbsp;</li></ul><p>The Marks lab believes that tiny protrusions on the surface of materials generate polarization when they are bent. This effect, known as flexoelectricity, is then what causes static electricity. Credit: Schematic courtesy of Laurence Marks/Northwestern</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But to prove it, Lin and Mizzi had to pour through the scientific record, looking for equations that modeled friction and flexoelectricity. Shower thinking punctuated the process, stepping away as they danced with the millennia-old mystery. They searched papers online, gathering all the equations they might need, then working through the math by hand, until finally the cloud of numbers and symbols coalesced into a model that really worked.<br>&nbsp;</p><p>\"Ultimately, we wanted to capture the big picture of it,\" Lin says.</p><p>The model makes sense, says Michael McAlpine, a professor of engineering at the University of Minnesota. \"It's such a simple explanation, I was surprised I didn't put my finger on that,\" McAlpine says. The Occam's Razor-approved end result, and the fact that the model builds off tried and true equations, make the model attractive as well.</p><p>The model provides a convincing explanation for static electricity produced between the same kind of material, but what causes it in other types of material — say, a liquid rubbing against a gas — will need to be tested against the model too. Every material on earth can create static electricity, so there's no shortage of test subjects.</p><h2>The upshot</h2><p>If the model proves accurate, the applications could be broad. Nanogenerators are tiny devices that harvest the surprisingly robust energy of static electricity. With enough basic knowledge, we could begin using the power of any friction against any material.</p><p>Triboelectric power has plenty of potential, says Wenzhuo Wu, an assistant professor of engineering at Purdue. If the basics of static electricity are better understood, we could maximize the efficiency of wind or wave power generators, Wu says.</p><p>The body's own movement could be used to power internal medical devices. Imagine being able to create a roof shaped to harness the power of a raindrop — the friction of the rain passing over the surface — to generate triboelectricity, powering the building below it.</p><p>Or the model may help do the exact opposite. Basic knowledge can lead to better controlling, or even eliminating, static electricity. The phenomena is shockingly dangerous in any environment where you need to avoid a spark. An accurate understanding of what causes triboelectricity can lay the groundwork for how to prevent it.</p><p>\"People have been thinking about this, and also experiencing this, without even realizing what they were experiencing for a very long time,\" Mizzi says. \"The scope of that is really neat and humbling.\"</p>", "created": "2021-08-25T15:59:44.900Z", "updated": "2021-08-25T15:59:44.900Z", "publish": "2021-08-25T15:59:44.896Z", "status": "published", "total_likes": 0, "users_like": [], "bookmark_list": []}}, {"model": "blog.post", "pk": 7, "fields": {"title": "The “Great Dimming” of Betelgeuse explained", "category": null, "cover": "cover/2021/08/25/deviantart_883159104_Ancient_Sword_-_Photoshop_Art_8I7xvby.jpg", "slug": "the-great-dimming-of-betelgeuse-explained", "author": 1, "body": "<ul><li>Last year, Betelgeuse dimmed by a third before returning to normal.</li><li>A number of studies blame some combination of cooling and dust.</li><li>The star is not set to explode anytime soon, much to the disappointment of many.</li></ul><p>One of the most notable stars in the night sky is Betelgeuse. Typically the tenth brightest star in the night sky, it is well known for its red color and prominent place in the constellation Orion. Its name, which like many other stars comes to us from Arabic, translates to \"the arm of the giant\" or \"the armpit of the great one,\" which is an excellent description of where it is located in that constellation.</p><p>As a semiregular variable star, it can undergo shifts in its brightness of varying intensity for irregular lengths of time. Scientists were not entirely surprised by an extended dimming of the star between November 2019 and March 2020. However, the magnitude of that dimming, a 35 percent drop, was remarkable — so much so that more than a few people began to speculate that the star was about to explode (or \"go supernova\" in astronomical parlance).</p><p>Astronomers all over the world turned their telescopes toward Betelgeuse in the hope of figuring out what was going on. A few recently published papers provide some explanations.</p><h2>A tale of two studies</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>One recent<a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-25018-3\"> paper</a>, published in <i>Nature Communications </i>by a team composed mostly of Chinese scientists, argues that the dimming was caused by a large, dark, cooler spot on the star.</p><p>To determine if the star was cooler during its dimming, the team devised a method for measuring titanium oxide and cyanide molecules in the<a href=\"https://casswww.ucsd.edu/archive/public/tutorial/Stars.html\"> star's spectra</a> — an analysis of the intensity of various wavelengths of light given off by a star that can reveal things like temperature, chemical composition, and mass. Titanium oxide and cyanide are more common in cooler stars, as they tend to disintegrate in hotter ones.</p><p>Their data suggested that Betelgeuse cooled by 170 Kelvin, from 3646 K (6103 F°) to 3476 K (5797 F°) during the dimming period. They suggest that such a dramatic cooling could be caused by a dark spot on the star, a well known phenomenon often caused by large convective cells on the stellar surface.</p><p>Because it is unlikely that the entire star cooled that much, the researchers further suggest that the dark spot itself was fairly large and as much as 340 K cooler than the rest of the star. Some other researchers concur with this <a href=\"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/ab9ca6\">proposal</a>, but this is not the only potential explanation.</p><p>Another<a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03546-8\"> study</a>, published in <i>Nature</i> and conducted by an international team of researchers, suggests that a combination of dust and cooling was at play. They propose that this dust patch was caused, in part, by a cool patch similar to the one discussed in the aforementioned study.</p><p>Observations from shortly before the dimming period began suggest that some mass, perhaps in the form of a gas cloud, was lost from Betelgeuse. The formation of a cool spot could allow the dust in the cloud to condense and clump together, obscuring the star. The star would regain its brightness after the cool spot dissolved and the dust blew away.</p><p>The authors further conclude that the models for cooling and dust do not conflict and that a combination of the two best fits the observations. While differing on a few details, including the overall importance of <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/17/science/betelgeuse-montarges-star-supernova.html\">dust</a>, the two studies largely agree on how much Betelgeuse cooled and how that cooling impacted our ability to see it.</p><h2>Betelgeuse! Betelgeuse! Betelgeuse!</h2><p>The star, while having long since returned to a more typical brightness, continues to fluctuate in brightness, though nothing on the scale of the previous \"Great Dimming\" event.</p><p>Despite speculation that the star was about to explode, it is not expected to do so for another 100,000 years. However, when it does, it is going to die in spectacular fashion — likely shining brighter than Venus for a short time before collapsing on itself and turning into a neutron star or black hole.</p><p>If you're going to pick a lucky star, maybe don't pick that one.</p>", "created": "2021-08-25T16:00:41.838Z", "updated": "2021-08-25T16:00:41.838Z", "publish": "2021-08-25T16:00:41.833Z", "status": "published", "total_likes": 0, "users_like": [], "bookmark_list": [1]}}, {"model": "blog.post", "pk": 8, "fields": {"title": "Light from other side of black hole shows Einstein is right (again)", "category": null, "cover": "cover/2021/08/25/deviantart_884357216_The_Dragon_Castle_-_Photoshop_Art.jpg", "slug": "light-from-other-side-of-black-hole-shows-einstein", "author": 1, "body": "<ul><li>A new study shows how X-rays bent behind a black hole can be observed by telescopes.</li><li>The findings were predicted by the theory of general relativity but never previously observed.</li><li>The researchers plan to develop a 3D model.</li></ul><p>Few interstellar objects entice the imagination quite like black holes, massive objects with gravity so powerful nothing — not even light — can escape them.

The light that would typically be reflected off an object, allowing us to see it, simply falls into the hole.</p><p>However, Einstein told us that gravity works less like a giant vacuum cleaner sucking things toward large bodies and more like a heavy object placed on a rubber sheet. Gravity is the dip in the sheet near the object. Things moving past this dip, be it caused by a star or black hole, can pass by it without necessarily falling into it, though their paths will be altered.</p><p>Similarly, light — which consists of both visible and invisible portions of the electromagnetic spectrum — emitted by distant objects can be warped or bent slightly by large objects. This makes the object that emitted the light appear to be in a different place to an observer. This phenomenon, known as \"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_lens\">gravitational lensing</a>,\" was used to validate elements of relativity a century ago: light from distant stars was bent when passing by the sun, just as Einstein predicted.</p><p>When astronomers examine black holes, they tend to take advantage of this warping. For instance, they look for distant light that is bent or focused by the black hole or to X-rays emitted from near the black hole (but far enough away not to fall in) to ascertain information about the black hole, such as its location.</p><p>This new study began in much the same way. A team of researchers was examining the coronas that form around black holes as material falls into them. This superheated material turns to plasma (ionized gas) as it falls in, though some of it is tossed about by the black hole's spin and magnetic field. This turmoil continuously produces huge amounts of vibrant X-ray light around the hole, which can be observed to learn more about it.</p><p><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/KSgh0HNJOnOVv41YfM_r0CPBRYQtilv_OpteOQ3XoAJMBRObqxX17coQe_bebMIgJuBEVRiMgMGDiImcyUzBKlPXQ5BFsC_1TCAD7XPhR6Y1ZSDWYzqwtLk_7LdvNiAunLOHoEXk\"></p><p><i>ESA</i><br>&nbsp;</p><p>While observing the expected X-Rays, the researchers noticed something odd; smaller, strangely \"colored\" X-ray flashes. The flashes were in line with predictions that X-rays would be bent and reflected behind the black hole before becoming visible again as \"echoes\" of light.</p><p>As Stanford University astrophysicist<a href=\"https://profiles.stanford.edu/wilkinsd\"> Dan Wilkins</a> and study co-author explains, this was both a surprise and in line with <a href=\"https://news.stanford.edu/2021/07/28/first-detection-light-behind-black-hole/\">theory</a>:</p><p>\"Any light that goes into that black hole doesn't come out, so we shouldn't be able to see anything that's behind the black hole. The reason we can see that is because that black hole is warping space, bending light and twisting magnetic fields around itself.\"</p><p>While relativity tells us that we should be able to see X-rays from behind a black hole because of its powerful gravity, this has never actually been seen before now. Study co-author<a href=\"https://profiles.stanford.edu/roger-blandford\"> Roger Blandford</a> of Stanford explained in a<a href=\"https://news.stanford.edu/2021/07/28/first-detection-light-behind-black-hole/\"> press release</a> why finding it now is so exciting for those who have long worked on the problem:</p><p>\"Fifty years ago, when astrophysicists starting [sic] speculating about how the magnetic field might behave close to a black hole, they had no idea that one day we might have the techniques to observe this directly and see Einstein's general theory of relativity in action.\"</p><p>The initial investigations into the coronas of black holes will continue, likely using more powerful X-ray telescopes as they become available. There are also <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/science/space/researchers-see-light-echo-black-hole-first-time-proving-einstein-righ-rcna1553\">plans</a> for making a 3D model to map these findings. The theory of relativity likely will continue to prove its worth for the foreseeable future.</p>", "created": "2021-08-25T16:01:32.727Z", "updated": "2021-08-25T16:01:32.727Z", "publish": "2021-08-25T16:01:32.723Z", "status": "published", "total_likes": 0, "users_like": [2], "bookmark_list": [2]}}, {"model": "blog.comment", "pk": 1, "fields": {"post": 8, "commentor": 2, "parent": null, "body": "<p>Nice one</p>", "created": "2021-08-26T09:56:51.272Z", "updated": "2021-08-26T09:56:51.272Z", "active": true, "total_likes": 0, "lft": 1, "rght": 4, "tree_id": 1, "level": 0, "users_like": [1, 2]}}, {"model": "blog.comment", "pk": 2, "fields": {"post": 8, "commentor": 2, "parent": 1, "body": "Tell", "created": "2021-08-26T09:57:28.275Z", "updated": "2021-08-26T09:57:28.275Z", "active": true, "total_likes": 0, "lft": 2, "rght": 3, "tree_id": 1, "level": 1, "users_like": []}}]
